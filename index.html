            </h2>
            <p>
              I graduated from UCLA in 2023 with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering &#128187; I enjoy full-stack development and helping others through technology.
              In fact, I devote a lot of my time to organizing events that introduce high school students to STEM. <br> <br>
              In my free time there are lots of things that I love to do. My favorite hobbies include visiting the beach, playing tennis, and trying new restaurants with friends. If I'm not
              doing any of those, I'm probably just relaxing and reading at home. <br> <br>
              The outdoors have always been a huge part of my life, so I am deeply concerned about the climate crisis. I would like to use my skills to educate
              people about the consequences of global warming. I hope that one day I can raise enough awareness about the issue so that we can begin to heal our planet &#127758;

                    I have a lot of pets at home: 20 tortoises, 2 turtles, 2 snails, a bunch of fish, dozens of shrimp, and a Yorkshire Terrier named Meatball.

                    I love the ocean &#127754; My favorite thing to do is explore tide pools at the beach to look for animals. Some
                    day I would like to live by the beach so that I can visit more often.

                  <li class="li-misc">
                    I've been lucky enough to travel a lot. Some of my favorite places were Alaska, Quebec, and St. Thomas Island. I hope to visit Hawaii,
                    Taiwan, and Alaska again to see the Northern Lights.
